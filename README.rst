check_notebook
==============

Do you collaborate with people giving you notebooks to review?
Maybe it is students that give you notebooks you have to grade?
Do you end up complaining because of empty code cells, errors lying
around, cells executed in a random order? If so, check_notebook is for you.

Quick start
-----------
